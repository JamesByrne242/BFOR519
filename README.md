# BFOR519
Final project

This is a ransomware similation, utilizing LOLBIN (PowerShell) in an attempt to learn more about the general flow on an attack.
The script will be ran in a controlled homelab environment, where I will recover the servers and workstations to their original states prior to the attack.
Finally, I will create an incident response plan and review the event viewer logs.
